"""Generate RIGOR.md — the public gate-coverage report for Paper-WorkFlow.

Why this exists
---------------
The competitive analysis in RELATED-WORK.md found that our two direct peers
(K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills`, Orchestra `AI-Research-SKILLs`) have no
executable research-rigor gate: K-Dense ships only a *security* scanner, and
Orchestra's "ARA Seal" rigor layer is markdown the LLM self-grades. Our
differentiator is the opposite — every load-bearing invariant about a paper run,
and about this skill package itself, is enforced by a script with a built-in
selftest, so a violation produces a non-zero exit, not a softly-worded warning.

That advantage is invisible unless we make it legible. K-Dense earns trust with an
auto-generated SECURITY.md + a live CI badge. This tool is the analog they cannot
produce: it enumerates every rigor checker, runs each checker's own selftest to
*prove the rigor machinery is sound*, and writes the result to a public RIGOR.md.
The report is the credibility artifact; the exit code makes it CI-enforceable.

What it is NOT
--------------
It does not score a paper run (check_workspace_gates does that for a workspace) and
it does not score this skill's quality (score_skill does that). It answers one
question — "are all of this skill's rigor checkers themselves passing their
selftests right now?" — and renders the answer as a trust badge.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/generate_rigor_report.py            # run all selftests, write RIGOR.md
    python3 scripts/generate_rigor_report.py --check     # verify RIGOR.md is up to date (CI)
    python3 scripts/generate_rigor_report.py --json       # machine-readable result
    python3 scripts/generate_rigor_report.py --date 2026-06-23   # pin the date (deterministic)

Exit code is non-zero iff a checker fails its selftest, an expected checker is
missing, a checker exists but is not registered (drift), or --check finds RIGOR.md
stale. The committed report body is deterministic apart from one dated line, so
--check can diff a fresh run against the on-disk file.
