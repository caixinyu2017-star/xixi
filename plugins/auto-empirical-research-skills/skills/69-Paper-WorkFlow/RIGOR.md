# RIGOR.md — gate-coverage report

**Rigor checkers selftest: PASSING — 29/29 green.**

Paper-WorkFlow's differentiator is that research rigor is *executable*, not advisory. Every load-bearing invariant — about a paper run, and about this skill package itself — is enforced by a script with a built-in selftest. This report runs each checker's selftest and records the verdict. A failure here is a non-zero exit, not a soft warning. Regenerate with `python3 scripts/generate_rigor_report.py`; verify freshness in CI with `--check`.

> Context: our two closest peers do not have this layer. K-Dense `scientific-agent-skills` ships only a *security* scanner; Orchestra `AI-Research-SKILLs` self-grades rigor in markdown. See [`RELATED-WORK.md`](RELATED-WORK.md) for the evidence.

The master gate `validate_skill.py` chains every leaf checker below (plus asset, template-contract, link, and notebook checks) into a single `python3 validate_skill.py` run maintainers must pass before shipping.

## Run-time gates — verify a paper run

| Checker | Result | Enforced invariant |
|---|:--:|---|
| [`scripts/check_workspace_gates.py`](scripts/check_workspace_gates.py) | ✅ pass | Method Gate / Draft Quality Gate / replication pack / claim-integrity / design-risk: a gate marked `pass` must have its evidence on disk, and ordering holds (quality gate never looser than the method gate). |
| [`scripts/check_method_gate_card.py`](scripts/check_method_gate_card.py) | ✅ pass | Method Gate design-card honesty: a passed Method Gate cannot have missing/failed design-card rows, hit hard flags, placeholder paths, or evidence claims stronger than the card permits. |
| [`scripts/check_runtime_fallbacks.py`](scripts/check_runtime_fallbacks.py) | ✅ pass | Runtime fallback honesty: missing tools, networks, MCP services, or statistical backends must be recorded in state decisions, stage logs, and backend reports, and blocked or non-parity fallbacks cannot pass Method Gate or replication readiness. |
| [`scripts/check_backend_capabilities.py`](scripts/check_backend_capabilities.py) | ✅ pass | Backend capability reports: Python/StatsPAI, Stata, R, and export stack availability must be recorded as structured status, missing dependencies, fallback backend, and probe timestamp before execution. |
| [`scripts/check_backend_parity.py`](scripts/check_backend_parity.py) | ✅ pass | Backend parity fixtures and workspace reports: fallback or secondary Python/StatsPAI, Stata, and R result bundles must agree on sample hash, estimator family, clustering, fixed effects, coefficients, standard errors, and diagnostics before parity claims can pass. |
| [`scripts/check_citation_integrity.py`](scripts/check_citation_integrity.py) | ✅ pass | Citation existence + temporal integrity: DOI resolution, retraction screening, citation-laundering, and look-ahead / vintage / sample-vs-claim-period leakage. |
| [`scripts/check_verification_log.py`](scripts/check_verification_log.py) | ✅ pass | The load-bearing methods-claim verification log exists and every claim it makes is backed by a recorded check. |
| [`scripts/smoke_workspace.py`](scripts/smoke_workspace.py) | ✅ pass | A minimal workspace initialises and every template contract holds (templates instantiate with the fields the gates later require). |
| [`scripts/check_demo_execution.py`](scripts/check_demo_execution.py) | ✅ pass | Bundled DiD demo execution: the notebook's code cells run in a temporary workspace, regenerate the table/figures, and preserve the core teaching estimates and staggered-adoption caution. |
| [`scripts/check_preregistration.py`](scripts/check_preregistration.py) | ✅ pass | Pre-registration lock: the primary specification is committed before estimation, and any main result not pre-registered is labelled exploratory (researcher-degrees-of-freedom guard). |
| [`scripts/check_review_scorecard.py`](scripts/check_review_scorecard.py) | ✅ pass | L2 review scorecard: all 7 dimensions scored, every finding carries a severity + verbatim evidence span + locator, a blocking finding caps its dimension <=4, and a declared PASS is consistent with the scores. |
| [`evals/check_replication_accuracy.py`](evals/check_replication_accuracy.py) | ✅ pass | Stage 3 output correctness: candidate estimates are scored against sourced gold coefficients on sign-correct, perfect-reproduction, and partial-or-better metrics; template cases cannot be scored as truth. |
| [`evals/check_quality_judge.py`](evals/check_quality_judge.py) | ✅ pass | Reproducible LLM-as-judge bookkeeping: the Draft Quality Gate verdict is recomputed from dimension scores, red flags, integrity status, and frozen calibration anchors. |

## Maintenance gates — verify this skill package

| Checker | Result | Enforced invariant |
|---|:--:|---|
| [`scripts/check_gate_integration.py`](scripts/check_gate_integration.py) | ✅ pass | End-to-end: a real workspace init flowed through real templates is accepted by the gate checkers as a coherent whole. |
| [`scripts/check_stage_scenario.py`](scripts/check_stage_scenario.py) | ✅ pass | Stage 0-9 golden-path scenario: a completed workspace must have per-stage logs, handoffs, key artifacts, final handoff recovery, a green workspace-gate card with table-result reconciliation, and a filled final delivery report. |
| [`scripts/check_stage_adversarial.py`](scripts/check_stage_adversarial.py) | ✅ pass | Adversarial Stage 0-9 scenarios: common corruptions of a completed workspace (missing artifacts, stale handoffs, broken reset coverage, unreconciled tables, non-final citations, and gate-order regressions) or unfilled final reports must be rejected. |
| [`scripts/check_design_gate_contract.py`](scripts/check_design_gate_contract.py) | ✅ pass | Design-gate-card contract: every contracted empirical design family has required artifacts, hard-fail conditions, allowed claim levels, behavioral guardrails, and a matching Method Gate template label. |
| [`scripts/check_method_specific_failures.py`](scripts/check_method_specific_failures.py) | ✅ pass | Method-specific failure fixtures: every contracted design family must have a failure fixture, and each fixture rejects missing or failed design-specific diagnostics before a Method Gate can pass. |
| [`scripts/check_state_template_paths.py`](scripts/check_state_template_paths.py) | ✅ pass | Workflow-state path contract: default artifact paths are safe workspace-relative paths whose parent directories exist in the init skeleton, and Stage 0 bootstrap artifacts exist after init. |
| [`scripts/check_reproducibility_scaffold.py`](scripts/check_reproducibility_scaffold.py) | ✅ pass | Replication scaffold: the run_all master script captures environment state, warns when no expected manifest exists, accepts matching outputs, and fails corrupted output manifests. |
| [`scripts/check_final_report_contract.py`](scripts/check_final_report_contract.py) | ✅ pass | Final-report contract: delivery handoffs must include validation commands, changed files/commits, failures and fixes, residual risks, and child/parent remote-parity status. |
| [`scripts/check_cross_references.py`](scripts/check_cross_references.py) | ✅ pass | Cross-reference contract: every internal link, named artifact, and script path referenced from SKILL.md and references actually resolves. |
| [`scripts/check_bilingual_docs.py`](scripts/check_bilingual_docs.py) | ✅ pass | Bilingual README parity: the Chinese and English user surfaces expose the same reference docs, script inventory, validation commands, and load-bearing workflow artifacts. |
| [`scripts/check_contract_matrix.py`](scripts/check_contract_matrix.py) | ✅ pass | Contract matrix: each quality theme has named owner files, validators, and docs, and high-leverage repo artifacts are covered by at least one maintained invariant. |
| [`scripts/check_rigor_registry.py`](scripts/check_rigor_registry.py) | ✅ pass | RIGOR registry completeness: every checker discovered under scripts/ or evals/ must be registered in this report, and registry drift is a blocking maintenance failure. |
| [`scripts/check_monthly_worklog.py`](scripts/check_monthly_worklog.py) | ✅ pass | Long-horizon maintenance evidence: the month-long worklog records the goal window, baseline PASS evidence, week plan, packet-level validation, and anti-cheat guards that prevent premature closure. |
| [`scripts/check_skillopt_packet.py`](scripts/check_skillopt_packet.py) | ✅ pass | SkillOpt improvement packets: >=3 train + >=2 held-out rollouts, a bounded edit budget, and accept requires a score gain + regression pass. |
| [`evals/check_complexity_budget.py`](evals/check_complexity_budget.py) | ✅ pass | Complexity ratchet: the always-loaded SKILL.md and the reference-file count cannot grow past the recorded ceiling without a justified bump. |
| [`evals/score_skill.py`](evals/score_skill.py) | ✅ pass | Held-out scoring-harness invariants for the SkillOpt selection gate (baseline vs candidate scored on the same rubric). |
