# Held-out evaluation harness (`evals/`)

Automated, reproducible scoring for the SkillOpt-style improvement loop in
[`../references/skillopt-improvement-loop.md`](../references/skillopt-improvement-loop.md).

## Why this exists

The improvement loop and [`../templates/SKILLOPT_PACKET.md`](../templates/SKILLOPT_PACKET.md)
gate every maintenance edit on a **held-out selection score**, but leave that
score to be filled in by hand. In real [SkillOpt](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt)
the selection score is computed by an `evaluator.py` over frozen train/val/test
splits — that automated substrate is what made the gate trustworthy.

This directory supplies the missing half: a mechanical scorer over a frozen
scenario suite, so the "held-out selection score" is a measured number instead
of a vibe. It is the validation set, not a replacement for the loop's judgment.

It is **standalone on purpose** — it imports nothing from the skill, so it never
collides with maintenance edits in flight on the core skill files. The full
scored run remains an explicit maintenance command, while `validate_skill.py`
now runs the scorer self-test plus the complexity ratchet so the local gate
catches broken eval machinery and always-loaded-layer regrowth.

## What it measures

A skill is a *document*, so the "rollout outcome" that matters is whether the
documented procedure still satisfies its own contracts on each task archetype.
The dimensions are the ones named in the improvement loop plus the ARS-inspired
claim-integrity checkpoint added for long paper workflows:

| Dimension | Scope | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| `routing_fidelity` | per-scenario | design → child-skill → tool anchors are documented in the routing references (`skill-map.md`, `analysis-backends.md`, `statspai-analysis.md`, …) |
| `gate_integrity` | per-scenario | the gate self-test passes **and** the design has a Design Gate Card |
| `context_protection` | global | subagent contract present: write outputs to disk, return a concise summary |
| `reproducibility` | global | a fresh workspace passes `scripts/smoke_workspace.py --quiet` |
| `user_burden` | global | `SKILL.md` documents autonomy gears + a minimal-question / authorization discipline |
| `integrity_checkpoint` | global | `SKILL.md`, `references/integrity-and-claim-audit.md`, the template, and the gate checker preserve the Stage 7 `pre-review` and Stage 9 `final-check` claim-integrity contract |
| `citation_temporal_integrity` | global | the complementary citation-existence + temporal-integrity layer is present: `references/citation-and-temporal-integrity.md`, `templates/citation_integrity_log.md`, `scripts/check_citation_integrity.py`, the look-ahead/vintage discipline, and the `--final` gate |

A scenario's total is the mean of the seven dimensions in `[0, 1]` (two
per-scenario + five global). A scenario is `success` at `total >= 0.70` (the
rubric's "meets bar"). The **selection-split mean** is the number a candidate
edit must strictly beat.

## Scenario splits

[`scenarios.json`](scenarios.json) freezes 14 research-task archetypes split
the SkillOpt way — do not move a scenario between splits to flatter a number:

- **train** (`did_staggered`, `iv_2sls`, `rdd_sharp`, `synthetic_control`) — may
  motivate an edit; never gate on these alone.
- **selection** (`panel_fe`, `ml_hte`, `time_series_var`, `psm_did_china`, `spatial_did_china`, `threshold_panel_china`) — held out; gates
  acceptance. **3 个中文场景（PSM-DID / 空间计量 / 门槛面板）** 反映国内顶刊常用方法。
- **regression** (`dml_highdim`, `causal_graph`, `policy_pilot_china`, `digital_transformation_china`) — held out; guards designs the
  current edit does not target. **2 个中文场景（政策试点 / 数字化转型）** 反映国内"中国故事"实证典型。

**中文场景对照**（`scenarios.json` 第 11-15 项）：

| Scenario | 中国实证典型应用 | 主要门卡 |
|---|---|---|
| `psm_did_china` | 最低工资 / 户籍改革 / 一次性政策评估 | §10 PSM-DID |
| `spatial_did_china` | GDP 锦标赛 / 环境溢出 / 区域协同 | §11 空间计量 |
| `threshold_panel_china` | 环境规制门槛 / 金融发展门槛 | §12 门槛面板 |
| `policy_pilot_china` | 数字经济试验区 / 智慧城市 / 自贸区 | §1 交错 DiD |
| `digital_transformation_china` | 年报词频法 + TFP（赵剑波 2020 类） | §1 交错 DiD 或 §10 PSM-DID |

**配套 replication case**（`replication_cases/`）：

| Case | 设计 | Gold 来源 |
|---|---|---|
| `card_krueger_1994_minwage.json` | PSM-DID 黄金标准（NJ min-wage） | Card-Krueger 1994 AER Table 3 |
| `threshold_panel_simulation.json` | Hansen 1999 门槛 | Own DGP, TRUE_γ=1.0, β差=1.0 |
| `spatial_sdm_simulation.json` | SDM + LeSage-Pace 分解 | Own DGP, ρ=0.3, indirect=0.5 |

## Usage

```bash
# Full scored run (runs smoke + gate self-test): the canonical baseline view
python3 evals/score_skill.py

# Structural-only, fast (skips the subprocess checks)
python3 evals/score_skill.py --no-scripts

# Machine-readable
python3 evals/score_skill.py --json

# Rollout lines ready to paste into a SKILLOPT_PACKET.md (default: selection)
python3 evals/score_skill.py --packet-lines selection

# Invariant self-test (no skill content required to pass)
python3 evals/score_skill.py --selftest
```

`--packet-lines` emits lines in exactly the format
`scripts/check_skillopt_packet.py` expects (`evidence=` + `score=`), so a
maintenance packet's Rollout Split can be populated from measured scores rather
than guessed ones.

## How it plugs into the loop

1. Before an edit, run the scorer and record the **baseline selection score**.
2. Propose a bounded patch (SkillOpt loop step 4).
3. After the edit, run the scorer again on a clean tree. Adopt only if the
   **selection mean strictly increases** and the **regression mean does not
   drop** — then paste the before/after into the packet's Gate Decision.
   When the score is already saturated at `1.000`, do not manufacture a score
   increase; use the complexity ratchet, validation gates, and worklog evidence
   to justify maintenance edits whose value is measurement or consolidation.

## Current baseline & active guardrails

See [`baseline_scorecard.md`](baseline_scorecard.md) for the captured baseline.
The first held-out miss has been resolved: `time_series_var` now has a matching
Design Gate Card, and the current train / selection / regression means are all
`1.000` under the seven-dimension scorer.

The active guardrail is now bidirectional: `validate_skill.py` runs
[`check_complexity_budget.py`](check_complexity_budget.py), which blocks
unjustified growth of `SKILL.md` or the reference-file count. That ratchet keeps
the saturated quality score from becoming an additive-only incentive.

## Sibling harnesses in this directory (output-correctness, not procedure score)

`score_skill.py` scores whether the *documented procedure* holds together. Two
sibling harnesses, ported from the systems surveyed in the project's competitive
analysis, measure things the procedure score structurally cannot see:

- [`check_replication_accuracy.py`](check_replication_accuracy.py) — the **Stage 3
  replication-accuracy benchmark** (after Econometrics-Agent, arXiv 2506.00856).
  Scores a candidate's produced estimates against a frozen **gold truth** on three
  nested rates — sign-correct / perfect / partial. This is the only eval here that
  fails a run whose paperwork is immaculate but whose numbers are wrong. Cases live
  in [`replication_cases/`](replication_cases/); the self-contained DiD case is
  anchored on the demo's `TRUE_ATT = 2.0`.
- [`check_quality_judge.py`](check_quality_judge.py) — the **reproducible
  LLM-as-judge harness** for the Stage 7 quality gate (after open_deep_research's
  gold-standard judge). Recomputes the PASS/NOT_PASS verdict deterministically
  from the rubric rule and calibrates it against gold anchors in
  [`quality_calibration.json`](quality_calibration.json), so a self-contradicting
  scorecard (bad arithmetic, fudged verdict, red-flag-cap violation) is caught
  mechanically.

Both are wired into `validate_skill.py` via their `--selftest`, and both are
standalone (import nothing from the skill), so they never collide with edits in
flight on the core files.

## Extending the suite

Add a scenario to `scenarios.json` with a distinctive (case-sensitive)
`routing_anchors` list and a `gate_card_keyword`. Keep anchors specific enough
not to false-positive on common words. Re-run `--selftest` after any change.
